# Audio DSP Final Project

This repository contains my **Electrical Engineering 4th-year final project**, which focuses on **Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for audio applications**. The project covers three main topics:

- **EQ (Equalization)**: Implementation of digital equalization techniques.
- **Room Simulation**: Simulating acoustic properties of a room using DSP techniques.
- **Neural Networks - Music Genre Classification**: Using machine learning to classify music genres based on audio features.

## Project Structure

```
üìÇ EQ
    - Code and documentation for audio equalization
üìÇ Room Simulation
    - Code and analysis related to room acoustics simulation
üìÇ Neural Networks - Music Genre Classification
    - Implementation of neural networks for music genre classification
üìÑ DSP Project Book - Rotem Tsalisher.pdf
    - Project documentation and technical details
üìÑ FinalPresentation_RotemTsalisher.pdf
    - Final presentation slides summarizing the project
```

## Technologies Used
- **MATLAB/Python** (for signal processing and ML tasks)
- **Deep Learning Frameworks** (for music genre classification)
- **Audio Processing Libraries** (for feature extraction and signal manipulation)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RotemTsalisher/AudioDSPFinalProject.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired module (`EQ`, `Room Simulation`, `Neural Networks - Music Genre Classification`).
3. Open on MATLAB to navigate through the code and see the different functions inplementation
